# Entrepreneur and Engineer at The Cooper Union

#### Technical Skills: Python, AWS, MATLAB

## Education	 			        		
- B.S., Mechanical Engineering | The Cooper Union (_Graduating May 2025_)

## Projects
### NFC Platform for Interactions and Product Authentication
I designed brooches, necklaces, hats and other wearbles to carry NFCs and allow for different scanning experiences. The NFCs linked to a webapp that allowed for product purchase, the sharing of digital art associated with a brand, and product authentication. Recieved feedback from users and iterated. Raised money and sold product.


### Ollie and Marie - Noise-responsive Robot for Young and Autistic Children
As part of a product design class, I created a classroom robot by outfitting a plushie octopus with LEDS and my smartphone. As part of this project I made an Android App to measure noise levels and  algorythmically display expressive faces to provide children with feedback about classroom noise levels.

### Personal Tools
Built Think-Tool and Regression-Tool which help me think and analyze data. Think Tool uses AI to create a worksheet that allows me to clarify and improve my thinking, it generates probing questions, and it suggests reading material for research. Regression tool allows me to analyze data
